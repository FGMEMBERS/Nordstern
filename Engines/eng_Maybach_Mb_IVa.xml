<piston_engine name="Maybach Mb IVa">
 <documentation>
   Maybach Mb IVa high altitude engine.

   [Vissering:1922:ZS]:
     260 HP above 10000ft
     From engine performance table, assuming that Maybach 1918 is MbIVa:
     260 HP, 1400 RPM, 390 kg, 0.200 kg/(hp hr)

   [PK:1994:LZ120] for Bodensee:
     Side engines had a propeller diameter of 3.2 m
     The aft engine had a propeller diameter of 5.2 m geared down about 2:1.
     4 Maybach Mb IVa-HÃ¶henleistungsmotoren (6 cylinder inline)
       190 kW max above 1800 m
       180 kW max below 1800 m
       2.2 kg/kW (implying an engine weight of 418kg)
       Specific fuel consumption: 270 g/kWh @ 1400 RPM
       Cruise consumption: about 45 kg/h (per engine)

   [Flight:1918:MB, pages 960 - 965]
     Technical description of captured Maybach 300 HP aircraft engine.
     Seems very similar to the Mb IVa so the dimensions may match.

     Bore:              165 mm
     Stroke:            180 mm (Computed from bore, compression ratio
                                and clearance volume)
     Compression ratio: 5.94:1
     Clearance volume:  778.9 cm^3
